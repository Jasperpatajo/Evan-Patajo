    <h2>Incredible Rio de Janeiro Hang Gliding Experience</h2>
    <p>I never thought Id go hang gliding. Then one day while in Rio de Janeiro my girlfriend said,
      A friend of mine told me that we should go hang gliding. That was all it took. We did 15 minutes
      of research, made a reservation and two days later we were in an Uber on our way to Sao Conrado
      Beach. It really was time for some Rio de Janeiro hang gliding. The whole experience happened quickly.
We met Paulo, the owner of Just Fly Rio and our main instructor, on the beautiful beach. We signed some
paperwork at the office of the local Rio de Janeiro hang gliding association. And then, after one last weather
check, we hopped into Paulos jeep and began the journey to the top of the nearby Pedra Bonita mountain (520 meters high).
We were fitted with gear, given a safety lesson and provided with a few minutes of instruction while an
assistant assembled the first hang glider. Suddenly, Georgiana was hooked up to the wings and the instructor
and two final safety checks were performed. Then, off they went. Running down the ramp and off into the sky,
straight into the clouds. It was nuts. At first, they immediately disappeared below, as if they plunged
straight off the ramp. But after ten seconds, they re-appeared in the mist, soaring upwards along the edge
of the mountains. And so her Rio de Janeiro hang gliding adventure began.Ten minutes later, it was my turn.
Henato, another instructor, showed up and we went through the same routine. Harness, instructions, safety check and before I had a chance to really soak it all up, I was also running down the ramp, attached to this huge green triangular wing.
And then the ground was gone and we were flying through the sky. Ill let this photo and video explain it all.</p>

      <h2>The Best Cafe in Lisbon Cafe da Garagem</h2>
        <p>It really is the best cafe in Lisbon. We figured this out as soon as we stepped inside.
The place is relaxed, well-decorated and offers comfy chairs perfectly positioned in front of huge
windows overlooking the city below. Theres a great balcony with tables, too. I think the view from this
cafe is one of the best views of the city by far.
The food and drink here are excellent and cheap. We enjoyed coffee followed by a bottle of vinho verde
(12 Euros) and a huge cheese and homemade jam platter that was more than enough for two people to get
stuffed on.
The staff are friendly, the atmosphere cozy and I cant think of a better spot to spend a couple of hours
in Lisbon, especially in the evening as the sun sets in front of you. (The cafe opens at 3pm or 5pm
depending on the day.)
As one review I read put it, Place should be packed, but its amazingly quiet.
I absolutely agree with that statement. Its the best cafe in Lisbon that apparently not many people know about.
This is Cafe da Garagem.
My girlfriend found it online one day when we wanted to escape the very touristy Rossio Square. We were
looking for something different and this place popped up, along with the words hidden gem.Its a
funny place to reach, Ill say that. Located on the same hill as, but underneath, the imposing Castelo
de Sao Jorge, we had to take two long outdoor escalators upwards, meander along a couple of narrow
residential lanes, walk up two big flights of stairs and then find the relatively simple entrance.
Its about a 15 minute wander from Rossio Square in the end.
But all that climbing and meandering is worth it!
As soon as we took a seat in front of the windows, we were thrilled that we chose this cafe for our
evening break. It wasnt too crowded at all, the wifi worked quite well in case you want to browse or
do some work on your laptop and nobody seems to care how long you stay there. Its open until midnight
 as well.
However, it really comes down to the view. Its worth it just for that, especially since youll be far
away from the tourist crowds on the Santa Justa viewpoint or any of the other well-known lookout spots that most tourists flock to.
Why not enjoy a perfect combination of atmosphere, comfort, quality food and drink and a slightly off
the beaten path location along with that view instead? Thats the combination that made Cafe da Garagem
the best cafe in Lisbon in our opinion.

<h2>A List of Travel Books That Are Never On Anyones List</h2>
<p>A few years ago, I took one of Earls tours to India (im in the above photo!). It was my
  first ever journey to Asia and I think one of Earls earliest tours as well, so we were both f
  inding our feet a bit.
Naturally, I wrote about the trip for the paper and the story has now found a second life in a
new anthology called Beyond Our Borders: Unexpected Travel Writing, edited by myself.
Earl was nice enough to write a foreword to the book and even nicer to let me write a guest post
on his blog. However, I promised him this wouldnt be a commercial for my book. So I need to find
something to write about that you folks might actually be interested in reading.
I have a great love for travel writing, as I suspect do you, otherwise you wouldnt be here. So
how about a list of travel books, a list of my favorite travel books Travel book lists can be found
all over the internet of course. The internet loves lists, after all. There is even a term for it:
listicle (which sounds like something you see a doctor to get lanced).
Perusing these lists, you will certainly see a lot of the same titles over and over again. You
will likely see some books youve never read or never heard of. However, there are some books you
will never, ever see, despite containing some truly great travel writing.
So here is my list of the top five travel books never on anyones list of travel books.<br><br>
1: In Cold Blood by Truman Capote
The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that
other Kansans call out there. Some seventy miles east of the Colorado border, the countryside,
with its hard blue skies and desert-clear air, has an atmosphere that is rather more Far West than
Middle West. The local accent is barbed with a prairie twang, a ranch-hand nasalness, and the men,
many of them, wear narrow frontier trousers, Stetsons, and high-heeled boots with pointed toes. The
land is flat, and the views are awesomely extensive; horses, herds of cattle, a white cluster of grain
 elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples are visible long before a traveler reaches them.
Creative Writing 101 should always begin with this opening paragraph of Capotes non-fiction novel.
This is a true crime book, not travel book, you say Perhaps, but to Capote, who was raised in the
South before becoming the doyen of New York literati, Kansas was every bit as alien as Mars, and he
wrote about it as such, observing the natives much as he might a primitive tribe on some remote
island.
There is more than Capotes view of the plains of the Midwest that fascinates the reader, however.
 As Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, the brutal killers of the Clutter family, hit the road, trying to
 evade capture, the book becomes a sort of homicidal variation of On the Road, with Hickok and Smith
 as evil twins of Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady.<br><br>2: The Mole People by Jennifer Toth
Published in 1993, this book is, in a sense, a pretty standard travelogue. The writer took trips to
an exotic locale not many have visited, interviewed the locals, learned the customs, and generally
tried to give the reader an impression of what life is like in this place that most will never see.
The reason nobody thinks of this book as a travel book is because this exotic locale is the grim,
underground tunnels of New York City, and the natives are mostly the homeless, the misfits, the outsiders of
polite society.
More recently, a fellow named Matthew OBrien wrote a similar book called Beneath the Neon, about
 those living in the tunnels under Las Vegas. Perhaps this is the start of a new genre.<br><br>
3: The Curse of Lono by Dr. Hunter S. Thompson
Fairly or not, many fans of the late father of Gonzo journalism were disappointed with the good doctors
account of the Honolulu Marathon. What they wanted was Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in Hawaii. What
they got was somewhat different.
Oh, there is still plenty of alcohol and drug fueled lunacy. The book opens on a plane and a passenger
exits the lavatory with a blue arm, having apparently dropped his stash down the toilet and then reached
in to retrieve it.
However, Thompsons view of the islands proved to be somewhat more thoughtful and introspective on occasion.
The big difference between Fear and Loathing and this book is that Thompson despised Las Vegas and everything
it stands for, whereas he clearly had respect and, in his own outrageous way, even love for the Hawaiian life.
It should also be noted that editing the book was something of an ordeal. It is liberally peppered
with passages from Richard Houghs The Last Voyage of Captain James Cook, which is in the public domain and
clearly added to pad the books length.<br><br>
4: Escape from Kathmandu by Kim Stanley Robinson
Why is a science fiction book on this list? It is true that many science fiction stories tell of explorers
and undiscovered lands, but those places are usually made up.
This novel is actually made up of four novellas, three of which were published in Isaac Asimovs Science
Fiction Magazine in the 1980s. That is what those in the publishing game call a fix-up.
These stories are about a pair of American expats in Nepal, George Ferguson, a mountaineer and tour guide
and George Fredericks, apprentice to a Tibetan monk. Together they encounter a yeti, Shangri-la and the
whole mythological milieu of that part of the world. But they also have to deal with the realities of
beggars in the streets and bureaucrats in the offices and villagers scrambling for a living and demanding
 tourists and bugs and mud and rain and all the things one has to deal with when traveling in a foreign
  country. Despite the fantastic elements, it gives a surprisingly realistic look at Nepal.
Plus, the book is funny as hell.<br><br>
5: Love, Poverty and War: Journeys and Essays by Christopher Hitchens
Hitchens is best known today as one of the founding fathers of New Atheism,  but he was first and foremost
 one of the best journalists ever to hold the job. His writing included not just politics but literary
 criticism, interviews and, yes, travel writing.
It is a pity he never published a book exclusively of travel writing, but of all the collections of his
 journalism, Love, Poverty and War probably comes closest.
Hitchens was British and, even though he lived much of his adult life in the U.S, his origins informed
 his views on Americana. He gives readers his impressions of traveling down Route 66 and Sunset Strip,
 as well as his thoughts on the cultural impacts of such American icons as Bob Dylan and William Faulkner.
This list easily could have gone on (and on and on and on). So you see, if you love reading about other
 worlds and other peoples, sometimes you dont want to stick to the obvious routes. Not unlike actual
travel. There is plenty of unexpected travel writing out there if you are open to it.

(I want to thank Gordon for inviting me to write the foreword for Beyond Our Borders. It was my first
foreword and it was an honor to write it. And Gordon, I definitely look forward to traveling with you
again somewhere, hopefully soon! Earl)
Do you have any interesting travel books to recommend that are not normally on lists of recommended
travel books?</p>

<h2>Seychelles: My Affordable Trip to Paradise (its possible!)</h2>
<p>In March, as many of you might have known from my recent blog and social media posts, I traveled to
   my dream destination for my 40th birthday.
That dream destination was the Seychelles, a tiny nation in the Indian Ocean consisting of
115 islands and home to only 89,000 people.
Ill come right out and say it if you dont have a dream destination, make it the Seychelles. Really.
Its like being in one giant, never-ending fantasy from the moment your plane begins its final descent
and little islands start appearing down below.
This place is tropical paradise in every sense. Ive never seen a paradise quite like this, with
perfect, and I mean PERFECT, white-sand beaches everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE, with gorgeous, lush
jungle covering the semi-mountainous island interiors, and a truly laid-back, were in the middle-of-nowhere
island vibe.
So, how do I talk about the Seychelles?
I could write a lengthy guide, but I dont think its necessary. Im just going to give you the main
details of how you can visit this destination for far less money than you probably imagine.
After that there are photos, plenty of photos below, that will take you on a journey through this paradise!</p>
